# AI-Based Adaptive User Interface (UI)

## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** into a **human-computer interaction (HCI)** system to create an **adaptive user interface (UI)**. The goal is to build a dynamic system that adjusts content based on **user preferences** predicted by a machine learning model. By predicting user behavior, the system adapts the displayed content in real-time, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Key Features

- **AI-Based Adaptation**: The system predicts user preferences using a machine learning model trained on user interaction data.
- **Dynamic Content Adjustment**: Based on predicted preferences, the system dynamically adjusts content (e.g., premium, standard, or basic content).
- **Clean and Minimalistic UI**: The adaptive UI is simple, clean, and easy to use, providing an engaging user experience.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/adaptive-ui-project.git


### 2. Set up the backend

In the `/backend` directory, you'll find a Python file called `model.py`. To install the necessary dependencies, create a virtual environment and activate it:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate



Then, install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

pip install -r requirements.txt


### 3. Train the AI model

In `model.py`, the model is trained on a dataset of user interaction data. Run the Python file to train the model:

python model.py


The model will output predictions, which will be used to adapt the UI content.

### 4. Set up the frontend

Open the `index.html` file in any web browser to view the adaptive UI. The JavaScript file (`script.js`) handles dynamic content updates based on the predicted preferences.

### 5. Start the application

Once the model is trained and the frontend is set up, you can view the project by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser. The page will load and adjust content based on the AI predictions.

## How It Works

- **Backend (Python)**: A **neural network** model is trained using **TensorFlow** on user interaction data, such as the time spent on a page and the frequency of visits.
- **Frontend (HTML/JavaScript)**: The content on the webpage is dynamically updated using JavaScript based on the predicted user preferences. For example:
  - **High preference** predicts that the user will see **premium content**.
  - **Medium preference** shows **standard content**.
  - **Low preference** displays **basic content**.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Model Overfitting**: To avoid overfitting, I used a **validation set** and adjusted the **epochs** during model training.
2. **Frontend Integration**: The frontend was initially set to receive real-time predictions from the backend, but for simplicity, I used **hardcoded values** to demonstrate the functionality. In future iterations, I would implement an API to pass predictions to the frontend.
3. **UI Responsiveness**: I ensured that the frontend adjusts dynamically using JavaScript, which updates the content based on the predicted preferences.

## Future Improvements

- Implement **real-time API communication** between the backend and frontend for seamless integration of live predictions.
- Add more **features** to the model, such as analyzing time of day or user actions (clicks, scrolls).
- Implement **user feedback** to refine predictions and improve the adaptive UI.
